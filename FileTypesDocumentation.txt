NOTE: all Particle Files are space seperated format 
=============================================================================================================================================================================================
									**** Full Particle File types ****
These are particle files which contain all information about each pixel in each cluster
=============================================================================================================================================================================================
_px.txt:
	This is the standard data where each entry represnts a pixel entries

	PixelXPosition[pixels] PixelPositionY[pixels] PixelToA[ns] PixelEnergy[keV]

	The start of a new particle cluster is then indicated by "#" 



_sim.txt:
	This is the data type that is very similar to _px.txt file types where each entry represnts a pixel entries

	PixelXPosition[pixels] PixelPositionY[pixels] PixelToA[ns] PixelEnergy[keV]

	The big difference is the start of a new particle cluster is indicated by "ParticleType=%d,Size=%d,Energy=%lf,Theta=%lf,Phi=%lf\n"
	This provides you information about the proceeding cluster
	It is call _sim file as this is the typical information you recieve from a simulation


".root" SATRAM file type:
	These are root files that are used when saving SATRAM cluster information 


".root" Benny file type:
	These are root files that are used by Benny when saving files such as seen in the MoEDAL 2018 data

=============================================================================================================================================================================================
									**** Single entry Particle File types ****
These are particle file types where each entry represents a single particle cluster
=============================================================================================================================================================================================

_feat.txt:
	These are file types used when calculating features for training of particle tracking models or analysis some basic cluster characteristics of a data set

	Each particle entry  consists of the following columns space seperated:
		RegionID: This is the region the data was obtained from, typically only relevent SATRAM data
			(where 3: Inside the SAA, -1: Cloud around the SAA, 2: Northern Horn, 1: Southern Horn, 0: outside all regions)
			This can be used for other experiments but is not and is set to -1 for all particles in the file
		PrimaryEnergy: This is the known primary energy of the cluster typically known for simulation data but for experimental data set to -1
		Theta: This is the real theta incidence angle of the cluster typically known for simulation data but for experimental data set to -1

		MinToA: Minimum ToA value recorded in the cluster
		Size: This is the number of pixels within the cluster
		Energy: This is the total energy deposition of the cluster
		MorphologicalClass: This is the morphological class
			(0:dot, 1:small blob, 2: heavy blob, 3: heavy track, 4: straight track, 5: curly track, 6: LIPs at low theta angle, 7:MeIPs at low theta angle)
		LLMTheta: The predicted Theta incidence angle using the improved LLM algorithm
		WMaxDimStd: The energy weighted standard deviation of position parallel to the line of best fit
		WMinDimBoxstd:  The energy weighted standard deviation of position perpendicular to the line of best fit
		MinDimBox: The you were to draw the smallest possible area box around the cluster it is the minimum of dimension of said box
		MaxDimBox: The you were to draw the smallest possible area box around the cluster it is the maximum of dimension of said box
		PrimarySize:
		dimx: The distance parallel to the x-direction from the left-most and right-most pixels in the cluster
		dimy: The distance parallel to they-direction from the top-most and bottom-most pixels in the cluster                      
		LineFitPhi: The predicted phi incidence angle using the energy-weight line fit method 
	       	WeightedPhi: The predicted phi incidence angle using the ToA weighted averaging method
	       	stdE: The standard deviation of recorded energy deposition of the pixels within the cluster
This information is provided in a space seperated csv format with each entry representing a single cluster


_sp.txt:
	These are the only file types that can be used as input for the decovolution algorithms (ResponseConstuctor.cc, Deconvolutor.cc)
	
	Each particle entry  consists of the following columns space seperated:
		RegionID: This is the region the data was obtained from, typically only relevent SATRAM data
				(where 3: Inside the SAA, -1: Cloud around the SAA, 2: Northern Horn, 1: Southern Horn, 0: outside all regions)
				This can be used for other experiments but is not and is set to -1 for all particles in the file
		ParticleType: This is the known particle type(p,e-,pi+,...) indicated by integer of the cluster typically known for simulation data but for experimental data set to -1
		PrimaryEnergy: This is the known primary energy of the cluster typically known for simulation data but for experimental data set to -1
		MinToA: Minimum ToA value recorded in the cluster
		AcquisitionTime: This is the acquisition time of the frame the particle is taken from which is typically only relevant TPX1 and TPX2 if taken from data without a frame time
				 such as in data driven mode this value is set to 0
		Size: This is the number of pixels within the cluster
		Energy: This is the total energy deposition of the cluster
		Height: This the maximum energy deposition in a singple pixel within the cluster
		theta: This is the predicted theta incidence angle using the improved LLM algorithm
		phi: The predicted phi incidence angle using the ToA weighted averaging method
		sp: This is the predicted stopping power using the theta value from the LLM algorithm and assuming the cluster pass completely through the detector

_tracking.txt:
	These are the file types typically used to output final information about the particles within the field, these are the file types through throughout the MoEDAL analysis

	Each particle entry  consists of the following columns space seperated:
		MinToA: Minimum ToA value recorded in the cluster
		PrimaryEnergy: This is the known primary energy of the cluster typically known for simulation data but for experimental data set to -1
		MorphologicalClass: This is the morphological class of the class 
					(0:dot, 1:small blob, 2: heavy blob, 3: heavy track, 4: straight track, 5: curly track, 6: LIPs at low theta angle, 7:MeIPs at low theta angle)
		Size: This is the number of pixels within the cluster
		Height: This the maximum energy deposition in a singple pixel within the cluster
		theta: This is the predicted theta incidence angle using the improved LLM algorithm

									**** ML File types ****
These are a variation of the typical file type 
=============================================================================================================================================================================================
These are variations of the typical file writers where theta caculation method is replaced by machine learning model


NOTE: At the moment this ML variation is only implement for _sp.txt file types and _tracking.txt file types 


=============================================================================================================================================================================================
									**** MiscellaneousFile types ****
=============================================================================================================================================================================================
