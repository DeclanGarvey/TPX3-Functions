This specialised C++ code for the data processin of Timepix and Timpix3 data (Rafael Ballabriga, Michael Campbell, and Xavier Llopart. “Asic developments for radiation imaging applications: The medipix and timepix family”. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/ URL: https : / / www . sciencedirect . com / science/article/pii/S0168900217307714.)

This is the code used to produce the some of the results presented in:

1. Timepix3 as a solid-state time-projection chamber in particle and nuclear physics, Proceedings of Science https://inspirehep.net/files/40698bfccc2ac859757e4284e4dbc7e8
2.  Improved algorithms for determination of particle directions in space with Timepix3, Journal of Instrumentation https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.00624.pdf
3.  Master Thesis: Advanced Methodology for Radiation Field Decomposition with Hybrid Pixel Detectors  https://dspace.cvut.cz/bitstream/handle/10467/108693/F4-DP-2023-Garvey-Declan-MastersThesis_DeclanGarvey.pdf
4.  Results and Perspectives of Timepix Detectors in Space - from Radiation Monitoring in Low Earth Orbit to Astroparticle Physics https://doi.org/10.3390/instruments8010017 

The code is full functioning but may contain bugs at this stage of developement. Currently in the process of fixing case bugs, improving performance, commenting, and creating documentation.
