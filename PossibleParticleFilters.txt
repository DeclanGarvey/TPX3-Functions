These are the list of possible of particle filters that can be implement in the function ./bin/FileConvertor by using using the flag -c <filename>
<filename> indicates the location of a config file of the form
ParticleFilter=ParticleFilterValue

NOTE: the filters should be ordered in order of computational intensity from least to most as the filters are implmement consecutively


Possible cluster filter are as follows:

	MinimumSize: Minimum number of pixels in the cluster
	MaximumSize: Maximum number of pixels in the cluster
	MinimumEnergy: Minimum total energy deposition of the cluster
	MaximumEnergy: Maximum total energy deposition of the cluster
	MinimumHeight: Minimum of value of the maximum energy deposition recorded in a single pixel
	MaximumHeight: Maximum of value of the maximum energy deposition recorded in a single pixel
	PrimaryEnergy: Only particles with a particular labelled primary energy value
	MinimumPrimaryEnergy: Paritcles with a mimimum labelled primary energy value
	MaximumPrimaryEnergy: Paritcles with a maximum labelled primary energy value
	MinimumTheta: Minimum labelled theta incidence of the particle, defaults 0.05 cm thickness for prediction but otherwised specified thickness for predictions in the form
			MinimumTheta=<MinimumThetaValue>@<detectorthickness 
			such as, MinimumTheta=0.1@0.03
	MaximumTheta: Minimum labelled theta incidence of the particle, defaults 0.05 cm thickness for prediction but otherwised specified thickness for predictions in the form
			MaximumTheta=<MaximumThetaValue>@<detectorthickness 
			such as, MaximumTheta=0.1@0.03
	MinimumPredictedTheta: Minimum predicted theta incidence using the improved LLM algorithm
	MaximumPredictedTheta: Maximum predicted theta incidence using the improved LLM algorithm
	MinimumPhi: Minimum labelled phi incidence of the particle
	MaximumPhi: Maximum labelled phi incidence of the particle
	MinimumPredictedPhi: Minimum predicted phi incidence using the ToA weighted averaging method
	MaximumPredictedPhi: Maximum predicted phi incidence using the ToA weighted averaging method
	MorphologicalClass: Only clusters of a particular morphological class
			(0:dot, 1:small blob, 2: heavy blob, 3: heavy track, 4: straight track, 5: curly track, 6: LIPs at low theta angle, 7:MeIPs at low theta angle)
	RegionID: Only paricles with a particular labelled region ID
	MinimumStoppingPower: Minimum predicted stopping power value using the improved LLM algorithm and assuming full pentration of the particle through the thickness of the detector, 
				defaults 0.05 cm thickness for prediction but otherwised specified thickness for predictions in the form
				MinimumStoppingPower=0.8@0.05	
	MaximumStoppingPower: Maximum predicted stopping power value using the improved LLM algorithm and assuming full pentration of the particle through the thickness of the detector, 
				defaults 0.05 cm thickness for prediction but otherwised specified thickness for predictions in the form
				MaximumStoppingPower=100@0.05	
	MinimumEndPoints: Minimum number of end point pixels in the cluster, end points are defined as 8-fold nearest neighbour less than or equal to 3 and tranisition value 1
	MaximumEndPoints: Maximum number of end point pixels in the cluster, end points are defined as 8-fold nearest neighbour less than or equal to 3 and tranisition value 1
	RemoveMorphologicalClass: Removes all particles of a particular morphological class
					(0:dot, 1:small blob, 2: heavy blob, 3: heavy track, 4: straight track, 5: curly track, 6: LIPs at low theta angle, 7:MeIPs at low theta angle)
	RemoveLIPs: Removes all Lowly Ionising Particles(LIPs), defined by (energy deposition) < (pixel size)*17 + 500
	RemoveMeIPs: Removes all Mediumly Ionising Particles(MeIPs), defined by (energy deposition) > (pixel size)*17 + 500
			NOTE: this allow removes highly ionising particles will need a more update version to identify such particles
	MaximumAcquisitionTime: Removes all particles obtained from a frame with acquisition time greater than the particular value, only relevent for frame based acquisition mode
